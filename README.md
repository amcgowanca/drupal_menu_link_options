## Drupal Menu Link Options

Menu links in Drupal 7 have a hidden property named `options` that is typically used by contributed modules for storing additional information or attributes. This module aims to provide an API for modules to define options with a user interface management component to allow for the management of options for those users who have appropriate permissions. Additionally, this module provides a mechanism for displaying these options.
